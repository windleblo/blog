# About Windleblo

Welcome to the sailing adventures of S/V Windleblo, a Hallberg-Rassy 40 that has been home to countless miles of cruising across the world's oceans.

## The Journey

This blog chronicles the sailing adventures from 2015 to the present, documenting voyages that have taken us from the coast of Maine to the Pacific Northwest, from the Great Lakes to Alaska, and everywhere in between. These waters have been home to:

- **East Coast Adventures**: From New York Harbor to the Maritime Provinces of Canada
- **Great Lakes Exploration**: Including the North Channel, Lake Superior, and the historic Welland Canal
- **Pacific Northwest**: From the San Juan Islands to the wild coast of Alaska
- **Remote Destinations**: Hidden coves, uninhabited islands, and pristine anchorages

## S/V Windleblo

Our Hallberg-Rassy 40 has proven to be an exceptional cruising platform, taking us safely through everything from calm anchorages to challenging ocean passages. Built for serious cruising, she's equipped for both coastal exploration and extended offshore voyages.

## The Stories

These posts capture not just the destinations, but the journey itselfâ€”the weather challenges, wildlife encounters, mechanical adventures, and the profound experiences that come with life aboard a sailing yacht. From navigating fog-bound passages to discovering secluded anchorages, each entry shares the reality of cruising life.
