It's hot, and blogging has gotten pushed to the back seat. Soaking in the Adriatic seems a higher priority.

(Roni is also our designated Shoreside Coordinator.)

In Montenegro, we anchored out at Kotor and Budva, taking in culture and scenery. Distinctly different from Croatia. Definitely feels closer to Moscow. Russian is the second most frequently heard language on the streets and Cyrillic letters adorn many billboards. Far fewer cruisers and tourists, too.

Next post will start with "Buongiorno" and end with "Ciao."
