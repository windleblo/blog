Here's an entry for the record regarding this season's spare parts provisioning. You may find it boring. Skip it if it's not of interest.

This was our last year taking delivery of a parts order from HR Parts, _the_ definitive source for spare parts for Hallberg-Rassy boats. There are many opinions about which and how many spares to carry aboard a cruising sailboat, largely driven by questions about use: How far do you range from civilization? Do you plan many (or any) bluewater crossings? Etc.

In our case, we expect to be relatively close to civilization (i.e., we're not planning an Antarctic expedition any time soon), and crossings are viewed as necessary only to get to the next cool cruising ground, so some sort of happy medium in selecting spares is in order.

Considering all the varied opinions (e.g., John Neal's _Cruising Companion_ , Nigel Calder's various books, broker Roger Johansson's viewpoint, and Vickie Vance's recommendations), below is the selection of spares and other sundry items we picked up from HR Parts before we left Ellos. These we added to an already growing stock of supplies we now carry on board, which were inventoried on this blog last year.

A few of the items aren't technically spares, more supplies or upgrades, but here's the complete list anyway:

Two (2) line snubbers

Two (2) packages of 20 curtain plastic hooks

One (1) shower hose handle only (for stern bathing platform)

Six (6) lock/lockers and drawer knobs, chrome

Six (6) oil filters

Six (6) boat hook clips

Six (6) plastic fittings to extension frame (2 hole)

One (1) toilet paper holder, stainless

Five (5) Volvo oil, 5 liter

Six (6) Boracol, 5 liter

Two (2) alternator belts

One (1) companionway cover with vinyl

Two (2) cockpit cushions, vinyl

One (1) Volvo air filter

One (1) Furuno autopilot processing unit ("brain box")

One (1) Volvo thermostat

One (1) 115 amp alternator

One (1) raw water pump complete

Three (3) Flex-O-Fold anode

Three (3) Anode, Side Power 4,6,8

Three (3) Isotherm refrigeration anode

One (1) Gulper 220 service kit

One (1) 12 V remote propane shutoff valve

One (1) Cutlass bearing 35 mm

One (1) Cutlass bearing removal tool, steel

Five (5) Racor fuel filters

Six (6) Volvo fuel filters

One (1) Volvo D255 starter motor

One (1) Gulper shower drain and bilge pump

One (1) antifreeze 5 liter

In addition to these items, we contracted with Johannes for two new stainless steel improvements -- a bowsprit and reinforced aft gate stantions both port and starboard.
