Please accept my humblest apologies, dear follower, for vacating my blogging duties for the our voyage up the East Coast from Florida to the Chesapeake. After the Atlantic crossing and Caribbean adventuring, I guess I just ran out of steam. Suffice it to say, it was a remarkable few months with experiences too full to recount in a brief post. The good news is, with the onset of the 2015 cruising season I've resumed blogging at the NEW, IMPROVED [www.windleblo.com](http://www.windleblo.com/) blog site. Please visit there often, and return here if you wish to reminisce with us about our European cruising.
