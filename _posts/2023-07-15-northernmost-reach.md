A lot of water under the keel since R2AK.

Many, many highs. A few lows. Extraordinary overall.

Among the highs:

Putting _Windleblo_ through her paces with gale force following winds and three meter seas through Clarence Strait the day after leaving Ketchikan

Finally making it to Tebenkof Bay and paddleboarding through a remote cove there

Catching crabs in Hoonah harbor

Watching National Geographic caliber sea life at South Marble Island, Glacier Bay

Hiking above Mendenhall Glacier near Juneau

Watching the Fourth of July parade in Juneau

Witnessing a tidewater glacier calve in Glacier Bay

Paddleboarding through icy growlers in Glacier Bay

Many whale sightings, including one so close we had to brake for it!

Fresh salmon catch in the Lynn Canal

Hiking to Burdette Cabin near Atlin

A couple of lows:

Having the Webasto heater break down in Glacier Bay

Getting warm with electric heaters in Juneau only to fry the shore power fitting (argghh!)

We’re now in a place called Atlin in northern British Columbia, having sailed _Windleblo_ all the way up the Lynn Canal to the tourist town of Skagway, our northernmost port of call. (Four cruise ships stop in Skagway each day at this time of year.) We’ve left the boat in Skagway to take a week of shore leave in Atlin, sort of a vacation from our vacation. Of course, there are many stories to tell. But a picture is worth a thousand words, so I’ll let the ones below do all the talking
