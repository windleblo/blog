We enjoyed a splendid sail to Sipan after a fuel and provisioning stop in Gruz (pronounced grooszh), the port for Dubrovnik. We anchored near the head of a long narrow channel where the small settlement of Luka Sipanska spread across the waterfront and up a gentle hill behind it. Moya and Jocelyn served a delightful local dish, hashed meat dumplings over potatoes, based on a  recipe they found in the Dubrovnik market. Good Croatian wine created a warm glow in the cockpit as we ended our first day in the islands.
