[![ photo DSCN0560.jpg](/assets/images/blogspot/2013/img_bf677169.jpg)](http://s373.photobucket.com/user/windleblo/media/Madeira/DSCN0560.jpg.html)We've arrived in Madeira, a fascinating Portuguese island 600 miles from Europe's Iberian flank. _Windleblo_  led us here flawlessly, allowing us the opportunity to put our watch schedule into practice and test several downwind sail arrangements. We took a berth in a marina on the island's western tip after four days at sea, a shake down for the longer ARC crossing to come. We've spent the two layover days here taking a windshield cruise along the island's spectacular north coast and populated south yesterday, then working through some boat prep items before shoving off once again tomorrow for the Canary Islands. I hope to post a few more entries on windleblo.com, but from here on out, followers should check the _Windleblo_ ARC blog at the [ARC website](http://worldcruising.com/arc/event.aspx), which you should bookmark now. Just scroll down to the blog entries and select _Windleblo_ from the drop down list. Also on the[ www.worldcruising.com](http://www.worldcruising.com/arc/event.aspx) site, you can soon select their Fleet Tracker, where you can watch _Windleblo_  as she crosses the Atlantic. Stay tuned for more as the adventure unfolds.
