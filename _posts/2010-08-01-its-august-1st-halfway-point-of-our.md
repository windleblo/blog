It's August 1st, the halfway point of our summer wanderings. To mark the occasion, we are announcing a "Name the Bikes" contest. Pictured above are our new Brompton folding bicyles. They need names. Last year, we held a "Name the Dinghy" contest, with fabulous participation and stellar results. The competition was so tough, two entrants were named as winners and received fabulous prizes. In the same spirit, we are holding a "Name the Bikes"contest. Rules are simple. Each bike needs a name, so entries should include names for both.To increase your odds of winning, enter as many times as you like. All entries will be recognized, and the winner will be named at the end of the season. Prizes will be awarded upon our return to the States. So dump that "dog days" attitude and spice up your life with an entry (or two, or three). Post a comment on this blog with your entry or send entries to windleblo@gmail.com. We (and our bikes) will appreciate it.
