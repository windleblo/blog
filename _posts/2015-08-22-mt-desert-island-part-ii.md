A great sail back from Great Wass Island, a lobster feast, and ceremonial presentation of the coveted, hard earned and well deserved  _Windleblo_ pride wear brought Mike’s final 48 hours aboard _S/V Windleblo_ to a close. Many thanks to him for his great attitude, helpful manner, and hard tithing; now he has a better basis for deciding whether to go sailing himself one day.

A layover day later, the new crew arrived — Jocelyn, Jesse, and Luna — and a second set of Mt. Desert exploration ensued.

It started with a windshield tour of Cadillac Mountain, the Acadia National Park loop road, Thunder Hole, and Jordan Pond House on Day One, continued with a eight mile hike up the Perpendicular Trail to Mt. Mansell (for the boys) and a shorter hike to the Echo Lake overlook and beach time (for the girls) on Day Two, and ended with a delightful, if somewhat foggy, bicycle tour through part of the 57-mile carriage road network around Eagle Lake and Jordan Pond, plus time in Baa-Haa-Ba on Day Three.

Next, we exit Somes Sound and head for Cousin Charlotte’s house in Brooklin. Stay tuned.
