“Ouch!” I scream as I pinch myself.

I still can’t believe we are about to splash _Windleblo_ into the Salish Sea for the final season of the ten year mission to sail from Sweden to Alaska. Like Christmas, it seemed it would never arrive, but here we are.

Hard labor this last week has primped her for the voyage and she is finally ready – freshly painted bottom, buffed topsides, stocked holds – and so are we. The launch Monday will end a long, crusty, dusty week in the boatyard for me and My First and Only Mate. Hats off once again to her for sharing all the joys of boat ownership. Then, after another day or two final prep on the dock we’ll set off. 

Our shake down takes us around and through the San Juan Islands with a combination of anchorages and marina stays. We’ll spend a few nights at Roche Harbor and Deer Harbor where we’ll meet up with several of our Applewood friends who are traveling to San Juan and Orcas Islands for a Fourth of July holiday week. After, we’ll cross the border to check out Canoe Cove Marina, Sidney, BC, a leading candidate for home port once we return from the North.
