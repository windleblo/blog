Jocelyn & I arrived last Tuesday in Italia, and are now installed in Brindisi. We prepped the boat, launched it Thursday, and are now on the dock at Navale Balsamo, a good Yard here. Yard owner Massimo Balsamo is doing a good job taking care of us. Luna and friend Caroline arrived here by train last Thursday and have been indispensable helping get the boat ready. After a few fits and starts, we now have all the pieces/parts for installing our new AirBreeze wind generator. Tomorrow should be the big day that we get it to start spinning. This is the last step keeping us from setting sail for Messina. Everyone has been good sports with all the boat prep. But harbor rot is setting in -- I can feel it. We need to get under way.
