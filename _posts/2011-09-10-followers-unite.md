I opened my email inbox yesterday to find a message from a follower I did not even know existed! I've posted it below. How reassuring to know the blog is actually being read! Thanks for the appreciation, Aidan. As for the rest of you, your feedback is always welcome. Let me know what you think of the blog, and what you'd like to read about. You can either enter a comment into the blog (you have to register as an official follower first) or, if that's too hard, you can reach me directly at windleblo@gmail.com. --Jack
