Final days are here once again in the transition from the land-based life. Ranch work punchlists are being knocked off, boat bags are being filled, crew plans are being finalized.

Here’s the crew lineup for the season:

Spring commissioning – Jocelyn

Leg 1, Detroit to Little Current – John Hranac

Leg 2, Little Current to Sault Saint Marie – John Hoopes, Asher Herbstman

Leg 3, Sault Saint Marie to Thunder Bay – John Renna

Leg 4, Thunder Bay around Isle Royale – Walt Lienhard

Leg 4, Apostle Islands to Duluth – Emily Hoopes

Boat prep and road trip to Seattle – Jocelyn

A poem is inspired.

Sailing Awaits

High Plains sun bakes thin June air.  
Days blend, lengthening as they go.  
Ranch chores distract  
As the sea calls again.

What? And Why?  
The Rocky Mountain sailor must get his fix.  
Trained to travel far  
To find oceans to cross.

Each spring the itch  
Once all summits are reached  
To return to the sea  
And cast off the land.

To breath sea air.  
To trim the sails.  
To peer over the horizon,  
Not in a dream.

But for real.
