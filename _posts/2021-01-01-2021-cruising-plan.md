Here’s a cut at a very tentative cruising plan for next season. Obviously, a lot has to develop in the post-COVID world to make the plan reality. In particular, the border with Canada has to open up to U.S. citizens. Fingers crossed.

If that doesn’t happen, watch for a Plan B post calling for a strong crew and a bluewater voyage from SE Alaska to Washington State. This is the season we bring her south to her new home waters.
