Well, there’s still a lot of mostly COVID-related uncertainty about how the year’s going to unfold. But you know what they say about plans — they are a basis for change.

For the first time, we’re excited to conceive a season without any pressure to make miles. The theme this year is to explore our new home waters, the Salish Sea. To help us do that, we’ve joined the Port Townsend Yacht Club and plan to tag along on their “Flex Cruise” to the Broughton Islands during the heart of the season.

Other than that, we’ll stay flexible and let wind and waves (and whim) set our course.

So here’s the sketch. 

March – April: Spring Commissioning at Canoe Cove Marina, North Saanich, BC; Shake down cruise to Port Townsend.

May – June: Travel by car from Golden to North Saanich. Begin inaugural exploration from Canoe Cove into the Salish Sea.

July – August: Shore leave during busy season for family reunion in Windleblo Cove, Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire.

September – October: Return by car to S/V Windleblo for a month of continued adventuring in the Salish Sea.

November: Fall decommissioning, Canoe Cove.

Stay tuned for updates as the goal posts move.
