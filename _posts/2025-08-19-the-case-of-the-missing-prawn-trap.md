Looking back, I know where and when it all went off the
rails.

Summer solstice 2024. Quatsino Sound. Just a couple of days
earlier, we had rounded Cape Scott, the halfway point on our circumnavigation
of Vancouver Island. 

Despite our lack of local knowledge, the certainty of an
approaching storm, and the waning of the longest day, we decided an undersea
ledge on the flanks of Quatsino Sound was a good place to drop our newly
acquired prawn trap and test our luck. Marking the spot, we repaired to a dock
at Winter Harbour a few nautical miles away to wait for the trap to fill.

As predicted, the gale blew in overnight. We chose to wait
it out at the dock rather than retrieve the trap in a tempest.

Returning to the mark once the seas calmed a day and a half
later the trap was nowhere in sight. The storm-tossed seas had gobbled it up. A
search of nearby shores yielded nada.

Humbled, we had to admit our ineptitudes. What were we
thinking? We’d broken all the rules. Most notably, the notion of only leaving
your trap down for a few hours at a time. Plus, to think our little trap could
ride out a big bad storm and its big bad waves rolling in unfettered off the
North Pacific was naïve. Amateur. Pathetic. Not to mention the embarrassment of
losing $500 worth of gear that had only yielded a handful of prawns on our one
previous successful deployment, making those prawns now worth about fifty bucks
each. Hope they tasted good! 

As one might expect, we tried not to dwell on it, tried to
put it behind us. Forget about it. Focus on the positive. After all, we still
had our crab trap and fishing rod!

Days passed. The sting of the loss wore off. We settled in to
new routines. Moved the boat south. Around the Brook’s Peninsula. Beyond Nootka
Island. All the way to civilization at Tofino and Ucluelet on the Island’s
western shore.

It was there that the text came in. On July 5th.
From a guy named Dean.

Dean had found our trap! Assumed it was lost. Pulled it up
and took it to his fishing lodge up Quatsino Sound. Texted the phone number
marked on the trap float. Our phone number.

A bit of back and forth texting ensued. Since we were now
miles from Quatsino Sound, we weren’t able to drive the boat to his lodge, but if
we could make it to the Coal Harbour float plane hangar he could leave the trap
with his buddy Joey. No problem, we said. We agreed we would do that in about a
week and a half.

Finishing our circumnavigation, we tucked the *Windleblo*
in her berth at Canoe Cove on the 12th. After reconfirming the plan
via text with Dean, two days later we drove the length of the island – about
250 miles – to Coal Harbour.

Arriving there, we could find neither Dean nor the trap!
Joey said Dean had been delayed. Frustrated, we had to leave to catch the last
ferry from Nanaimo back to Vancouver, still trapless.

En route, we got yet another text from Dean. It said he had
sent a text the night before advising that the trap wouldn’t be a Joeys. He had
been unable to deliver it in time. Could we meet him later? He had only just noticed
that the text never went.

More texts back and forth. Dean was very apologetic when he realized
the effort we had made to keep the agreed appointment. We asked him if he could
hold on to the trap over the winter; we would try to collect it next season. He
assented.

And there it was, still off the rails. The case of the
missing prawn trap remained unresolved, leading us to the objective of the current
voyage – solving the case.
