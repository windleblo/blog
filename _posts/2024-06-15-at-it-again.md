We’re cruising north again aboard the _Windleblo_ , this time intending to circumnavigate Vancouver Island in six or seven weeks. We is me, Christine, and Frida, the 2024 crew. We drove _Windleblo_ out of her Canoe Cove berth June 3rd after a spring commissioning sequence that included standing rigging replacement and a new Starlink antenna clamped to the wind generator mast.

Six days and three stops later we were ready to transit the Seymour Narrows and begin our cruising in earnest. We’re now anchored on the north side of Broughton Island in a remote cove near the Broughton Lagoon, a brackish lake that requires navigation of tidal rapids to enter by dinghy.

All the good things about cruising are rushing back – fresh salty air, wind in the face, the feeling of freedom – and the metaphorical “daily rising tide” of a too long to do list has been replaced by the literal diurnal tidal cycle and the sounds of wind singing in the rigging and waves lapping at the hull.

Helping to keep spirits high is Frida. Sailing with a dog has its downsides (lots of dinghy trips to shore!). But whatever the inconveniences, they are more than compensated by the uninhibited curiosity, boundless energy, and warm loving gazes a dog brings to the mix. And Frida is proving to be a quick study in boat dog competencies, relearning quickly all the lessons from the Healing Voyage of two seasons ago – how to stay calm when heeling over in a stiff breeze, how to jump into the dinghy and back onto the boat, and of course how to hold her pee until its business time. One thing she has yet to figure out, though, is the purpose of the little green astroturf mat put out on the deck when we’re at anchor. She still thinks it’s for lounging, not peeing! Maybe soon we’ll have a breakthrough.
