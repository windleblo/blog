Crossing from Sardinia, we experienced an extraordinary sunset at sea. As the sun set, the sea was dead calm, creating an infinite horizon where sea blended into sky. By morning, the winds picked up, but not too strong, pushing us into Trapani. We took a berth at Marina Levante,  a small marina with good facilities and not too pricey.
