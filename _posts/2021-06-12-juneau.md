Two layover days in Juneau. The usual requisites – refuel, reprovision, recharge. But also some great reconnaissance.

A hike up a wonderful nature trail. Juneau is reputed to have the best hiking trail system in Southeast Alaska. We sampled it.

A bike ride from Auke Bay to downtown Juneau via Mendenhall Glacier. It was only 20 miles but seemed like 40. Probably because we had just sat on a boat for a week.

Wonderful encounters with the natives. Allison welcomed us warmly at the Auke Bay harbor office. The lady bartenders at the local craft brewery were all smiles. Austin and Monica of Sea Globe, a 65-foot Amel ketch, helped us get to and from Safeway and Costco in their pickup truck. (Yes, there’s a Costco in Juneau!) And pretty much everyone we met was very friendly and helpful. Jocelyn even commented that the Alaskans were giving the Canadians a run for their money on being nice.

Oh, and lest I forget, the bald eagles. Here, they’re as common as crows. Some as big as bear cubs. All appear well fed.

Below are a few images of our brief time in Juneau. Next up: Glacier Bay.
