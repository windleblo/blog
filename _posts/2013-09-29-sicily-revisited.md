Our destination: Milazzo on Sicily's northern coast. We were once again leaving the European mainland behind. To get to Milazzo, we needed to sail through the Strait of Messina, a gauntlet of rips, whirlpools, and eddies first made famous in the Odyssey of Greek mythology. Our progress was slowed at times by up to three knots as we dodge standing waves reminiscent of the Pacific Northwest. We hadn't seen tidal rips like this since Ireland! But then we were through and we turned west toward Milazzo and Marina Santa Maria Maggiore. A skiff came out to greet us and soon  we were securely Med moored to the dock.

We introduced them to Sicily with a delicious eggplant Parmesan dinner. The next day, we set sail for the Isola Eolie, or Aeolian Islands. Our first stop? Stromboli. We got a taste of Sicily's volcanoes last week when we ferried from Reggio to Messina, rented a car (65 Euro for a Fiat Panda from Europcar), and drove 80 kilometers south along the coast toward Mt. Etna. The road was as good as any U.S. superslab, though not as wide, blasting alternately through mountain tunnels and over long bridge spans. We wound up Etna's southeast slopes through charming villages and thick forests, the forests eventually giving way as we climbed to scrub brush and finally barren rock. The road ended in a big parking lot where tourists swarmed, many queuing up to pay 29 Euro for a gondola ride to the top. Having ridden many gondolas before, we opted to hike up the lower slopes to loop around the rim of a crater.

The island loomed larger as larger as we progressed on our 30 nautical mile sail from Milazzo, a perfect volcanic cone sloping steeply from the sea. We arrived at sunset and anchored off the ferry pier near the island's main village. The next morning, we dinghied ashore and for 50 Euro reserved the final two slots for a guided hike up to the top of the island. This was the only way to view the volcanoes active volcanic eruptions as unguided hikers were forbidden to climb higher than 400 meters. John and I would go. Kelly and Jocelyn opted to stay in town.

Soon, the tour guide appeared. We were each issued a red climbing helmet and told that the ascent would take three hours, the viewing at the top one, and the descent two more hours. We would be back in town around 10 p.m. to meet Jocelyn for a dinghy ride back to the boat.
