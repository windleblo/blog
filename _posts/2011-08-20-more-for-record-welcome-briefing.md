Our first season, we came up with a laminated lime green sheet full of do's and don'ts as a guide for orienting crew new to the _Windleblo_. We borrowed heavily from an orientation created by John Neal and Amanda Swan Neal for their bluewater training voyages, one of which I took in 2008. We even stole the sheet's title, "Doing Your Part."

Well, now that we have a fair bit more experience, we think it's time to revise the sheet more to our liking. Here's the new version.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Doing Your Part

The following are general rules for your time aboard _Windleblo_. Jack and Jocelyn will share with you the reasoning behind each during your welcome briefing. 

Tidiness - _Windleblo_ is your home during your voyage. Please keep her clean, tidy, and shipshape at all times.

Make your bed and tidy your cabin upon rising.

Do not leave any items lying on your bunk. Keep all surfaces free of personal items whenever we are under way.

Hang clothing and other items only in hanging lockers. Do not hang anything from hatch fittings or door handles.

Everyone (that means you, guys) pees sitting down.

Duty Roster - Complete your assigned duties as soon as possible in the morning and before shore activities.

Shoes - Wear only non-marking soled shoes on board that have never been worn ashore. Use separate shoes/sandals ashore - stow these in a plastic bag.

Foul Weather Gear - Wear your foulies whenever conditions warrant to keep you and your clothes dry. If at all damp or wet, put on and remove foul weather gear in the cockpit. Never wear damp foul weather gear below decks. Once removed, damp or wet foul weather gear should either be left in the cockpit or taken directly to the head to hang on hooks until dry.

Saltwater - Avoid getting salt below decks. Salt crystals attract moisture making items damp and susceptible to corrosion and bad smells. If your clothes are salty, do not sit below or lie on your bunk. After swimming or encountering salt spray, rinse off with fresh water on the aft deck. After encountering sand and salt, rinse feet, shoes and belongings with salt water, then with fresh water on the aft swim step.

Sand - Don't bring sand below. Check your shoes, pockets, and backpack.

Sunblock - Please use a minimum of sunblock lotion as it rubs off on the cockpit cushions, interior varnish, and upholstery damaging them. If applied to areas other than your face, please cover up or wash it off before sitting anywhere.

Interior Wood - Please be kind to the soft mahogany interior wood work. No belt buckles or clothes with studs or protruding zippers. Be gentle with all doors, drawers, and hatches - never let go of the catch when opening and closing them, and please don't slam them shut or jam anything inside. Treat _Windleblo_ gently.

Showers - Fresh water is very limited aboard _Windleblo_. To conserve, we take showers onshore whenever possible. If an on board shower becomes necessary, use as little fresh water as possible.

Plumbing - To prevent clogs, we send as little down the drain as possible. Toileting should be done on shore whenever possible, particularly No. 2. When necessary on board, use as little T.P. as possible. All shaving should be done on shore or, if using a cordless electric shaver, above decks. Please do not send hair or fingernails down the toilet or drain. All food scraps should be disposed of in the waste bin, not the drain.

Laundry - There is not sufficient fresh water on board for washing clothes. All laundry is done ashore when available.

Electricity - Please conserve! Turn your fan and lights off when not in use.

Water - Please conserve! Never let the tap run. Use only what you need.
