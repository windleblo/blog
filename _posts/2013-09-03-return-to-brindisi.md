Jocelyn and I have arrived in Brindisi and are readying the boat. Our major domo, Massimo, who is in charge of the work at Cantiere Navale where _Windleblo_ has been resting all summer, says "No Problema" to installing the new wind generator I bought last week in Colorado and schlepped over here in my checked bags. So _Windleblo_ will be totally untethered to the dock for our westward cruising thanks to a newly installed water maker and wind turbine. Yes! Tomorrow, we fight jet lag to punch through the list of boat commissioning tasks. Thursday, we launch!
