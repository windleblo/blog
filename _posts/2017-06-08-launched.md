## Dinner last night!

Today, _Windleblo_ was launched at Souris Marina, Prince Edward Island, Canada. The season has begun!

Spring commissioning has not been without challenges – skinned knuckles during engine work, unexpected broken components, friendly Canadian border agents telling us to comply with their rules we have to backtrack 100 nautical miles to international waters before heading to Quebec, cold wet weather – but spirits among Captain and Crew (i.e., Jocelyn and me) couldn’t be higher.

We are in the water feeling _Windleblo’s_ familiar rock and roll and now only have to wait for a final replacement part before setting sail.
