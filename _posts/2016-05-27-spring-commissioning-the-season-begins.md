Still on-the-hard, but hard at it getting the boat ready for launch, now scheduled for next Tuesday. After a marathon drive from Denver to South Freeport and several days of recovery, Jackson Williams has joined me to plod through the spring commissioning punch list. Scott & Debbie Belanger and Lisa Fink & Kevin Cassidy, dear Colby friends, have opened their homes to me as the work progresses. John Brewer at Brewer South Freeport Marine has offered his staff, tools, and shop to help the job along. So far, all is routine, with the exception of a frozen head holding tank valve, ruptured domestic water system expansion tank, and severed sat phone antenna cable, but that’s the way it goes…

Soon, I’ll post a detailed spring commissioning punch list for anyone needing a bedtime sedative.
