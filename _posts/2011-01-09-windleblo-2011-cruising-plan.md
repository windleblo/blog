Hello! It's been awhile since our last blog entry. Looking out my window in Golden, Colorado, this frosty morning, I see new snow piling up...hardly the setting to prompt thinking forward to summer cruising.

But that's exactly what we're doing! Entered below is the _Windleblo_ Cruising Plan for 2011. With a little help from our friends, we'll move the boat from Sweden to Spain, with Scotland, Ireland, and Portugal the season's featured cruising grounds.
