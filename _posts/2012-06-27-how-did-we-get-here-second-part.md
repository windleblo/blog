The weekend we returned to Colorado from our charter was the annual block party. As we mixed and mingled with our neighbors, we raved to whoever would listen about our San Juan Island adventure - probably very boorish behavior - but we were still on a natural high induced by the ocean air. People listened politely, then changed the subject to more germane topics, like prospects for early snow as the Rocky Mountain ski season approached.
