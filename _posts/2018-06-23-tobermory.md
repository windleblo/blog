Twenty-five hours. That’s how long it took for the 140 nautical mile passage from Sarnia to Tobermory. Beam reach, starboard tack, 16 knots of wind pretty much the entire way. Superb!

Now in Tobermory, Ontario, comparisons with Tobermory, Isle of Mull, Scotland, are unavoidable. _Windleblo_ has now been to both. Of course, there’s no way that this Tobermory can hold a candle to the Scottish version in terms of photogenic-ness.

Here’s Tobermory, Scotland:

## No comparison, eh?

But, of course, Tobermory, Ontario, is populated by wonderfully nice Canadians, which more than makes up for its lack of photogenisity. While sampling the brew at the Tobermory Brewing Company (which in addition to nice brew has nice poutine), we chatted with Bill and Sarah. They told us of some wonderful anchorages nearby and also about the Collins Inlet across the Georgian Bay.

With their advice, we’ve now divined a stellar itinerary for the next week, once again proving the value of “local knowledge.”

Stay tuned.
