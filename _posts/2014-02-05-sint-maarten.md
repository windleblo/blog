Blog posts still few and far between. We've made it from St. Lucia north to Martinique, Dominica, Guadaloupe, Antigua, and now Sint Maarten. Along the way we hiked to the world's largest boiling lake, paddled up the tropical river where "Pirates of the Caribbean" was filmed, partyed with superyachties at Antigua Race Week, and enjoyed several fantastic beam reach sails. Now, it's time for crew change. Jon Hill left this morning to go back to Denver and nine degrees farenheit. Olive will be leaving us soon to jump to another boat, and John's college buddies will sky in for the weekend. All a prelude to Jocelyn finally arriving here next Tuesday.
