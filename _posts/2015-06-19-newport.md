Yachts, mansions, and beautiful rocky coastline. That in a nutshell describes Newport, Rhode Island.

Crossing from The Block on Saturday, June 13th, with Brother Bill, we entered Narragansett Bay and left _Windleblo_ on Bill’s mooring ball off Plum Beach. The next couple days were spent visiting with Bill’s family and sailing up to Bristol to visit the Hereshoff Museum where we learned about the remarkable run for Herreshoff yachts winning America’s Cup races in the first half of the 20th century.

Yesterday, we sailed around Beavertail Point at the south end of Jamestown Island and into Newport harbor. The harbor master welcomed us warmly as we took one of the town’s mooring balls for the evening. We began our exploration with a dinghy tour of the harbor and a bicycle tour of the neighborhood. The next day, we walked along the famous Cliff Walk among some of America’s most prime real estate.

Below are some images of what we saw:
