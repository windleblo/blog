In addition to the Welcome Briefing, each new crew member receives a safety orientation shortly after arrival aboard _Windleblo_. We recently realized these briefings are guided only by scattered notes. We've organized our thoughts more carefully into the notes below - archived here for the record.

Once again, credit is due to our Cruising Guru, John Neal, for much of the content, borrowed from Mahina Tiare III lessons.

SAFETY ORIENTATION

ATTITUDE

Your attitude is your best safeguard against accidents. When confronting a task or situation, always take the safest, most conservative approach. _Windleblo_ is not the place to "push the envelope" or take unnecessary risks. Think before acting. If unsure, ask for help.

FIRE

There are three sources of fire risk on board _Windleblo_ - electrical, diesel, and galley. Always take special care when engaged with any of these elements. With the exception of the galley stove, no open flames are permitted on _Windleblo_. Smoking is not permitted. Take a moment to find and examine the on board fire extinguishers. Discuss fire extinguisher and fire blanket operation.

In a fire emergency,

Alert everyone on board by loudly shouting "FIRE!!"

SECURE ALL PORTS, hatches, and bulkhead openings.

Attempt to EXTINGUISH THE FIRE IMMEDIATELY.

If engine room fire: DO NOT open engine room door. Push plug through bulkhead, insert fire extinguisher nozzle, and discharge.

Helmsperson HEAVE TO to minimize airflow below decks.

MAN OVERBOARD

Rule #1: Stay on the boat! If you witness someone fall overboard, immediately shout "MAN OVERBOARD" to alert the entire crew. Then,

One person POINTS TO THE VICTIM never taking eyes off them.

HELMSMAN TURNS WHEEL Â½ TURN TO WINDWARD and walks carefully back to the Lifesling.

DEPLOY THE LIFESLING AND LIFEBUOY.

DEPRESS THE MOB button on the Furuno.

NOTE THE BOAT'S HEADING, BRING THE BOAT IN A CIRCLE through the eye of the wind, backwinding the jib. Continue circling until the Lifesling reaches the victim.

STOP THE BOAT by furling the jib and mainsail. CHECK FOR LINES in the water.

PULL THE VICTIM TO THE SWIM STEP AND ASSIST ON BOARD. If unconscious, rig a hoist with the Kato lift.

ABANDON SHIP

 _Windleblo_ is equipped with a life raft and survival gear for use in the unlikely event it becomes necessary to abandon ship. In an abandon ship emergency,

SOUND ALARM LOUDLY to alert everyone.

HEAVE TO.

DON LIFEJACKETS.

DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SAVE THE BOAT.

THE CAPTAIN MAKES THE DECISION TO ABANDON SHIP.

Once this decision is made, crew then proceeds as assigned with the following:

DAMAGE CONTROL.

Issue MAYDAY from VHF.

Depress DSC Distress button on VHF and SSB radios.

Activate EPIRB and PERSONAL LOCATOR BEACON.

NOTE GPS POSITION ON FURUNO or handheld GPS.

Launch LIFERAFT.

Collect DITCH BAG AND FLARE CONTAINER .

The life raft is secured in a cradle on deck just forward of the hard dodger. To launch, remove the canister from the cradle, make sure the tether is attached to a hull strong point, lift the canister over the rail on the leeward side of the boat, drop it into the water, and yank on the tether to inflate. BE SURE THE LIFE RAFT TETHER IS SECURELY TIED TO THE BOAT BEFORE PULLING IT. Otherwise, it may drift away from the boat once inflated.

The ditch bag and flare container are located under the companionway ladder.

To make a MAYDAY call,

Switch to VHF Channel 16.

Depress the DSC distress button.

Depress the microphone transmit button and say "MAYDAY" three times.

Then say "This is Windleblo, Windleblo, Windleblo. MAYDAY."

Give position (latitude and longitude).

State nature of distress.

State nature of help required.

Give any other information that may assist rescue.

Listen on the same frequency for acknowledgement.

If any other ship interrupts, say: "SEELONCE MAYDAY."

To activate the EPIRB, 

Remove the EPIRB from its bracket.

Extend the antenna.

Tear the tab over the activation button.

Push the button in and slide it to the left.

KEEP THE EPIRB WITH YOU.

To activate the PLB,

Remove the PLB from its bracket.

Extend the antenna.

Press the "Test" and "GPS I/O" buttons simultaneously for one second.

KEEP THE PLB WITH YOU and do not submerge it.

WATCH KEEPING

On longer passages, the Captain will establish a Watch Schedule. Duties while on Watch are as follows:

Be on deck with harness on ready to go five minutes early.

Before assuming the watch, make sure that you understand the watch orders and sail plan.

You are the **eyes of the ship** and it is essential to maintain a vigilant 360 degree lookout.

Ensure the vessel remains on course by hand steering or autopilot.

Regularly check the AIS and radar for other vessels. Watch for fishing buoys or floating hazards. Take avoidance measures as needed.

Make hourly log entries.

Constantly monitor sail trim, wind shifts or increases, and approaching weather. Adjust sails as needed.

Regularly check engine gauges and exhaust if motoring. 

Understand and obey Standing Orders.

End of Watch duties:

Pass on any pertinent information to the relieving watch. Don't leave surprises.

Make log book entry.

Check that all lines in the cockpit are neatly coiled and that no lines are in the water.

In the absence of a Watch Schedule, Watch duties shall be shared by all crew members above decks. Whenever you are in the cockpit, please continuously scan for potential hazards and immediately communicate noteworthy observations. In shallow protected waters, it is often a good idea to watch for hazards from the foredeck. When going below decks, confirm that remaining crew is vigilant. Do not assume someone else is maintaining watch.

End of a sail procedure:

Furl headsail and mainsail.

Coil lines, hang sheets.

Make end of sail log entry.

Stow binoculars and tethers.

Switch off Furuno, Autopilot, VHF, and instruments. Replace covers.

FIRST AID

The First Aid kit is located in a plastic box on a shelf beneath the sink in the head. Notify the Captain of any injury requiring first aid.

STANDING ORDERS

For emphasis, several safety oriented rules have been established by the Captain as Standing Orders. These are:

PFDs shall be worn by crew at all times when above decks.

All crew shall be tethered to a hull strong point or jack line when above decks as conditions warrant.

At least two crew members shall be above decks whenever work outside the cockpit is necessary.

WAKE OR CALL THE CAPTAIN IF:

You see any unrecognizable lights, ships, or objects.

You notice approaching weather; lightning or low, dark clouds to windward.

A significant increase in wind speed or change in direction occurs.

You hear any unidentifiable sounds.

IF IN DOUBT, ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON.

The captain who knows that s/he will be awakened by the crew for these or any reason ALWAYS sleeps better!
