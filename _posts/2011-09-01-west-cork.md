Yesterday afternoon, we said goodbye to John who was a big help during his two weeks aboard _Windleblo_. An extremely able seaman, John helped us move the boat more than 350 miles from Ardfern in Scotland to Cork in southern Ireland. Along the way, we had great times together exploring Dublin, touring distilleries and breweries, and searching for the perfect pint. It was a lot of fun. Thanks, John. You're the best.
