Our Caribbean exploration continues with island hopping in the British Virgin Islands. Jocelyn and friend Claudia Smith came aboard in Sint Maarten, and we convinced, without much trouble, Olivia to stay on, before our new crew of five set off for a full moon crossing to Virgin Gorda, the eastern-most of the 50+ British Virgin Islands. In the past week, we've set anchor at Anegada, the Baths, Norman Island (a.k.a., Treasure Island), and Soper's Hole, Tortola. The biking, hiking, and snorkeling has been magnificent. Last night, we ceremonially conferred Windleblo crewdom on Claudia, awarding her the official Windleblo pridewear t-shirt as she completed her time aboard. This morning, we put her on a ferry for St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, and a flight back to Denver. We set sail tomorrow for Culebra, Spanish Virgin Islands, and thence Puerto Rico.
