Crossing from Sicily, we checked into Malta at Mgarr on the northern island of Gozo, the Customs and Immigration officer making the process easy. A few steps from the docks, we were sipping two euro G&Ts on the balcony of the Glen Eagle Bar overlooking the harbor. We were very near the last port of call for the season and the 2,500 nautical miles since County Cork, Ireland, had made us quite thirsty.
