Not blogging much now. Scarce internet is the current excuse, but more likely the lack of blogging energy is due to the Caribbean sun. We have just completed a sail south to St. Vincent and the Grenadines, stopping at the mysterious island of Mustique (for their annual Blues Festival) and the Tobago Cays (to swim with the turtles). Now, we have retraced our track to Rodney Bay for one more dance with St. Lucia before turning north to explore Dominica and Guadaloupe.
