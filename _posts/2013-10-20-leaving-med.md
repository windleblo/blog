At O dark thirty last Wednesday morning, John and I put Andy ashore to catch a plane back to Africa. Since then, with only two brief stops at anchor to eat and rest, we have driven the boat 400 nautical miles along the Costas del Bravo and Sol of southern Spain. We arrived in Gibraltar yesterday afternoon and took a berth in Ocean Village Marina where we instantly met another ARC crew on their way to the Canaries. We'll take a break for a few days (after polishing the boat, of course), leaving the boat here to travel by car to Sanlucar to check out Luna's scene. Below are a couple of shots of our Balearic experience. The first is of Cala En Porter on Menorca where we swung at anchor for a night. The second is a poster we found in Ibiza town where we checked out the clubs. The next time we set sail it will be to leave the Med behind.
