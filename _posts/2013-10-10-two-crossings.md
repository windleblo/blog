We arrived in Mahon, Menorca, yesterday, having accomplished two 200 nautical mile crossings over the past eight days, the first from Palermo, Sicily, to Cagliari, Sardinia, and the second from Carloforte, Sardinia, to Mahon, Menorca. Both crossings went well for boat and crew. We enjoyed following breezes, Force 5 (high teens, low twenties) for the first crossing, with two meter following seas part of the way. The Force 4 winds were just forward of the starboard beam all the way from Carloforte, propelling us along at six knots. We'll rest here for another day before continuing west. It's good to be back in Spain.
