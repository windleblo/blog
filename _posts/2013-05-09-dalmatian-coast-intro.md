All in all, back, boat, and crew performed well on the passage from Malta. The check-in process was fairly painless, though not as convenient as Spain or Italy where all we had to do was show our boat papers to the marina reception people. Here, a stop was required with the harbor master, followed by a second stop at the Customs and Immigration office up the street. Forty-five minutes, 20 forms, and 2,500 kuna (around $400) later, I had my Croatian "vignette," or cruising permit, and we were off. But not far. We anchored less than 100 yards from the harbor master's office out in the center of Cavtat harbor for the weekend, completing a crew change. John Hoopes and Karolina were going and Jocelyn and Moya were coming.

Our introduction was highlighted by an extraordinary dinner as guests of the Brautovic's, who own the estate where John stayed when not on duty as a Backroads trip leader last summer. The Brautovic's run an agro-tourism farm and restaurant less than five miles from Cavtat harbor. They put on a fabulous spread, starting with a greeting of home-distilled flavored brandy and continuing through anti-pasta, salad, lamb & potatoes, and caramel custard pie. Before the weekend was over, we took a tour boat to Dubrovnik to take in the old city, complete with a "wall walk" and lunch in one of the many fine restaurants there.
