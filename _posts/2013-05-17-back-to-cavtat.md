Now we need water to wash the boat, something that has been hard to find around here. While beautiful, Croatia is not yet set up for the cruising sailor. Starting with tacking drills in 18 knots, we drove the boat back to Cavtat to meet our Austrian friends Martin and Dawn. They flew in from Vienna today to spend the weekend with us. With Chris and Ann, now the _Mahina_ cohorts were together again, and we toasted our reunion with pink champagne. It was five years ago that we first met as trainees aboard _Mahina Tiare III_.
