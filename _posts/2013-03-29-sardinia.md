Leaving Menorca, we flew our gennaker through the night and arrived in Carloforte, Sardinia, in mid-afternoon on August 10th. We spent 18 days on Sardinia, averaging less than 10 miles per day --  a perfect pace to take in the sights, enjoy the food and culture, and recharge our batteries. Several captioned images follow.

Most notable were Julie and Eugene, a UK couple who we first met on the beach in Porto di Malfatano and then again at Marina del Sole. Jocelyn also found a kindred spirit in Catherine, a woman who hailed from New York but was traveling the Med with her Aussie husband aboard their 42-foot Valiant. Our time together was all too short as the winds soon lined up to push us further east toward Sicily.
