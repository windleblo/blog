My son John, his girlfriend Nikki, and I met near Annapolis May 8th to prep the boat. One long weekend of hard work later, _Windleblo_ was launched and ready for the 2015 season. We sailed her 250 nautical miles in 48 hours, stopping briefly in the Delaware Bay to wait for the tide to go our way, before arriving in New York City. She is now swinging on a mooring ball at the 79th Street Boat Basin and while we take in New York prior to cruising through the infamous East River tidal rips of Hell Gate late next week to begin our New England exploration.
