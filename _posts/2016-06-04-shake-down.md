## Windleblo being launched at South Freeport

Yesterday we took a shake down sail around Casco Bay to exercise boat and crew. All systems are now “GO” for blast off to Nova Scotia next week. Preliminary forecasts look good for crossing mid-week. My passage plan is to shove off the dock at South Freeport on Tuesday for a 40 nm day sail to Monhegan Island. We’ll tie up to a mooring there for one night, then cross 200 nm around Cape Sable and make landfall at Shelburn, NS, by the end of the day Thursday. Cross your fingers that the forecast continues to look good.

For those who want to know, below is pasted the day by day spring commissioning punch list we accomplished to get this far.

Removed expansion tank for replacement.

May 27 – spoke with John Brewer re satphone antenna breakage caused by shrink wrap cover – he seemed to say he would have it taken care of. In the process, he called my wind generator mast “rinky dink.” He also announced that we could either launch Tuesday or get the deck polished Tuesday and launch Wednesday. I said we would launch Tuesday. He then said we would have to do our own deck polishing and he would provide tools and materials; added coolant (60% H2O, 40% Volvo coolant) to engine and topped off engine oil with 15W40; mounted MOB gear on pushpit, including danbuoy, horseshoe buoy, and lifesling – lifesling was in new warrantied replacement case; cleaned shroud deck plates; cleaned & polished nav light mounting brackets, installed nav lights and wired them in place; painted anchor locker boards and dinghy seat with second coat of gray paint; applied final coat of varnish to washboards & flagstaff.
