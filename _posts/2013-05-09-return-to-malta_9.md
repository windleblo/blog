Unbelievably, another cruising season is upon us. As I write this, I am skying eastward aboard United Express 3456 to Toronto, then on to Frankfurt and finally Malta. Son John is accompanying me to start the season, though he's not on this particular airplane. He's now on a flight to Dulles, and then on to Frankfurt where we will join up, the separate itineraries a vestige of the proclivities of award travel booking.
