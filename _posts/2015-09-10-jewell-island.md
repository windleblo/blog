WWII submarine tower.

A Monhegan layover later, we returned to Portland for another crew change. A day sail with King Browne was sandwiched between airport runs for Luna and Jesse (jetted off to Amsterdam) and John Renna (red eye in from Albuquerque). John and I quickly shoved off for Jewell Island.

Close to Portland, Jewell sits on the outside edge of Casco Bay. Carved into the north corner of the island is Cocktail Cove where we set the hook in good mud.

On shore, the islandâ€™s particulars revealed themselves. Once a World War II outpost for Uboat surveillance, the island is now administered by the State of Maine. To-die-for shoreside camp spots were linked by cobble beach and pine forest footpaths to derelict WWII gun emplacements and submarine observation towers creating an odd mix of recreational resource, nature preserve, and museum exhibit. Surprisingly, the state had left the submarine towers open, allowing us to enter and climb to the top for stunning views of Casco Bay.

Returning to the boat, we mixed dark and stormies for happy hour in Cocktail Cove as the sun dipped in the west.
