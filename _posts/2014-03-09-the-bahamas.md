A lot of water has passed under the keel since my last post. Anchorages have come and gone, crews have changed, and more than 700 nautical miles have been logged. We now find ourselves tied up to a dock at the Exuma Yacht Club, Georgetown, Great Exuma Island, The Bahamas. Highs along the way: 

  * Fish tacos out on the deck at Zacos Tacos in Dewey, Culebra Island, Puerto Rico.
  * Renting a car for a windshield tour from San Juan to Ponce, Puerto Rico.
  * Shopping at Costco in Caguas, Puerto Rico, our first Costco boat reprovisioning ever!
  * Playing tourist in Old Town San Juan.
  * Listening to students singing "Baby Beluga" at an event at a primary school administered by the Fundacion Mahatma Gandhi in Las Terrenas, Dominican Republic, where Emily interned as a Freshman in college.
  * Watching humpback whales just off the Caicos Bank on Day Two of our DR to Exuma passage.
  * The night sky and following breezes while at sea for four days from the DR to the Bahamas, the _Windleblo_ unbridled once more.

Lows to balance the highs:
