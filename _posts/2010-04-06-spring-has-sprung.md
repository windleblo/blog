Spring has sprung, and we are busy getting ready for the cruising season. Here's a sampling of preparatory activities: 1\. Procure equipment and supplies -- Among this year's upgrades are a gennaker, a whisker pole, navigation laptop and software, an AIS system, Windleblo pridewear (shirts with the Windleblo logo), and folding bikes. My current assignment is to research electronic charts and Jocelyn's is to fabricate slip covers for interior upholstery. 2\. Continue our training regimen -- Activities include a Celestial Navigation refresher, ASA 104 course (to qualify for the International Proficiency Certificate), and a Charleston to Nassau passage last month aboard Empirical, Mark Williams' HR43. 3\. Apply for Russian Tourist Visa -- The biggest bit of red tape we are dealing with this year. 4\. Crew confirmations -- At this writing, our crew line up looks like this May 27 - June 15 Martin & Philip June 17 - July 2 Jocelyn & Emily July 3 - 8 Side trip by train to St. Petersburg July 9 - 17 Martin & Dawn July 18 - August 13 Jack & Jocelyn (and hopefully John for a week or so) August 14 - 29 Leon & Lydia August 30 - September 14 Jack & Jocelyn This morning, I Skyped Johannes who reports that Windleblo is "sleeping nicely" in her shed. The custom bowsprit we requested has been fabricated and the AIS system is slated to be installed late this month. Our flights are booked and all systems are "go" for this year's adventure.
