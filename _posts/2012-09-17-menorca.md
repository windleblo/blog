Well into the season, we had fully adjusted to live aboard life. The boat was once again home. To Jocelyn, there seemed to be more living space on _Windleblo_ this season, a sense she attributed to the warmer weather. Last season, most of our time was spent below decks to escape the Scottish cool and damp. Now, sunny skies and dry air invited us outdoors, effectively doubling our living space. We strung a hammock from the mast to the forestay and broke out the deck chairs.
