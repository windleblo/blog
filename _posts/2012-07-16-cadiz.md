Culatra did its job. We were tanned and rested, ready for a summer of exploration. Cadiz, Spain, was our next stop. Our daughter, Emily (a.k.a., Luna -- more on that later), was scheduled to arrive in Cadiz (pronounced CAH-deeth) on June 27th, to join us for the next leg of our voyage. We sailed there directly from Culatra, an 80 mile day, the wind cooperating once again -- not too much, not too little, and from the right direction. We took a berth at Puerto America Marina on the very tip of the Cadiz peninsula. We spent the next few days absorbing Cadiz's extraordinary atmosphere. A few photos help explain our experience.

With the air temperature at about 90 degree Fahrenheit and a touch of humidity, the cool water was very popular.

Shops and residences mixed easily offering easy access to life's necessities.
