<meta name="description" content="Summer has set in. It’s hot, and blogging has gotten pushed to the back seat. Soaking in the Adriatic seems a higher priority. From Lastovo, we mostly motored, sometimes sailed back to Cavtat where we were joined by our new crew, beloved Applewood friends Doug Redosh and Roni Teitelbaum. (Roni is also our designated Shoreside Coordinator.) Checking out of Croatia and checking into Montenegro was smooth as silk. In Montenegro, we anchored out at Kotor and Budva, taking in culture and scenery. Distinctly different from Croatia. Definitely feels closer to Moscow. Russian is the second most frequently heard language on the streets and Cyrillic letters adorn many billboards. Far fewer cruisers and tourists, too. Tonight we push off from Bar, Montenegro, for our crossing to Brindisi, Italy. Next post will start with “Buongiorno” and end with “Ciao.”" />
