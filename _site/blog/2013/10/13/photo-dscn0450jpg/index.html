<meta name="description" content="John Hoopes has arrived! Early yesterday morning, Andy gave John Hranac a dinghy lift to the beach in Cala en Porter, Menorca, to catch a taxi ride to the airport for the return to Colorado. Many thanks for John Hranac for helping Windleblo get further west. Andy and I immediately weighed anchor for a 70 nautical mile downwind sail along Menorca’s southern shore, across open water to Mallorca, and then along the spectacular mountainous northwest coast of Mallorca. We settled back on our anchor in Port de Soller at sunset. Twelve hours and several texts later, we rendezvoused with John Hoopes in the charming town of Puerto d’Andratx. John had skyed into Palma, Mallorca, after a weekend celebrating Luna’s 23rd birthday in Barcelona, then taken a bus to meet us. John Hoopes is now busy playfully reconnecting with cousin Andrew. Tomorrow, we cross to Ibiza for a final day with Andy." />
