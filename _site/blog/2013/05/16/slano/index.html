<meta name="description" content="Today we took an eight mile walk up into the hills behind Slano, a small tourist town at the head of a large protected bay where we tied Windleblo up to the dock while the wind gusted to 30 knots. Our walk turned into a quest to observe the striped necked terrapin, a rare and endangered species of turtle that inhabits the ponds near Majkovi, a small hamlet in the hills behind Slano. Once nearby, the reclusive reptile proved hard to find, but like our search for Carbonia solar lamps on Sardinia last season, we were not to be denied. Eventually, our vigilance was rewarded when several of the turtles poked their head above the algae-filled waters and winked at us. Our mission accomplished, we headed back downhill toward the boat. Five kilometers later, we were enjoying gin and bitter lemon in the cockpit as happy hour was in full swing. Chris Adams, one half of our current crew, prepared a delicious risotto dish served with grilled chicken and corgettes as our evening meal.
