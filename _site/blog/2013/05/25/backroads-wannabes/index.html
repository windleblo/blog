As mentioned earlier, John Hoopes spent last summer here as a Trip Leader for Backroads.com. He escorted many a high roller on fantastic bike tours throughout the Dalmatian Coast. As he left the boat in Cavtat earlier this month, we asked him for guidance on cool bike tours in these islands. He soon sent us an email with instructions. From Korcula town, he said, “there’s a lovely short out-and-back to Racisce, which is pretty flat and along beautiful water. If you want a big ride, go up to Pupnat – long uphill.”" />
