<meta name="description" content="We’ve arrived in Madeira, a fascinating Portuguese island 600 miles from Europe’s Iberian flank. Windleblo led us here flawlessly, allowing us the opportunity to put our watch schedule into practice and test several downwind sail arrangements. We took a berth in a marina on the island’s western tip after four days at sea, a shake down for the longer ARC crossing to come. We’ve spent the two layover days here taking a windshield cruise along the island’s spectacular north coast and populated south yesterday, then working through some boat prep items before shoving off once again tomorrow for the Canary Islands. I hope to post a few more entries on windleblo.com, but from here on out, followers should check the Windleblo ARC blog at the ARC website, which you should bookmark now. Just scroll down to the blog entries and select Windleblo from the drop down list. Also on the www.worldcruising.com site, you can soon select their Fleet Tracker, where you can watch Windleblo as she crosses the Atlantic. Stay tuned for more as the adventure unfolds." />
