    <p>Damariscotta (pronounced DAM-ruskotta) sits at the upper reaches of the river by the same name. Twelve nautical miles under engine power, dodging lobstah pots all the way, and we took a mooring ball arranged by my long lost Colby roomie, Jeffrey McKeen, within sight of town.</p>

<p>Jeffrey, a.k.a., Smokey of the Old Grey Goose Down East Band and the Pemaquid Oyster Co., and I had not seen each other since college graduation. It took an intervention by John Allan, another Colby buddy, to make sure we didn’t miss each other again.</p>

<p>A month or so ago, JA (as John is known by his friends) emailed me and told me he was arranging for the <em>Windleblo</em> to be escorted up the Damariscotta by the <em>Oyster Girl</em> , the flagship of the Pemaquid Oyster Co. fleet. JA would drive north from Virginia to assume the honorary title of Admiral of the fleet. On JA’s orders, <em>Oyster Girl</em> would rendezvous with <em>Windleblo</em> at the mouth of the river and pilot her north.</p>

<p>The appointed morning dawned bright and clear. Walt Lienhard, yet another Colby friend, had come aboard <em>Windleblo</em> in Portland to crew while Jocelyn traveled back to Colorado. Leaving Boothbay Harbor behind, we sailed into the Damariscotta River. Sure enough, within a mile the <em>Oyster Girl</em> crew appeared. Frenzied hand waving and hailing ensued and we soon settled into to a mellow pace headed north. On the way, we paused at Smokey’s oyster farm to see the oysters growing in their pens. Afterward, we arrived at Damariscotta and a spirited weekend commenced.</p>

<p>The cast included me, Walt, Smokey and his wife Kayli, JA and wife Raji, and Lisa Fink, also a Colby alum, and her husband Kevin who came up from their home in Brunswick, Maine. Highs ranged from great meals shared aboard <em>Windleblo</em> and at Smokey and Kayli’s rustic Maine cabin on the banks of the river to enjoying a Friday evening gig by the Old Grey Goose at the Schooner Bar in town to a round of Molkky at Smokey’s home grounds.</p>

<p>But the highest high was simply enjoying the comfort and magic of each others’ company as if 40 years had not evaporated since our last engagement.</p>

<p>Thanks, JA, for putting it all together.</p>
