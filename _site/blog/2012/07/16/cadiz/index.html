Our daughter, Emily (a.k.a., Luna – more on that later), was scheduled to arrive in Cadiz (pronounced CAH-deeth) on June 27th, to join us for the next leg of our voyage. We sailed there directly from Culatra, an 80 mile day, the wind cooperating once again – not too much, not too little, and from the right direction. We took a berth at Puerto America Marina on the very tip of the Cadiz peninsula. We spent the next few days absorbing Cadiz’s extraordinary atmosphere. A few photos help explain our experience. The people of Cadiz really like their beaches. With the air temperature at about 90 degree Fahrenheit and a touch of humidity, the cool water was very popular.

The gates through the wall had to be remodeled to accommodate 21st century traffic. The view from the top of the cathredral suggests a clean city in dress whites, perhaps consistent with the city’s heritage as the long-time headquarters of the Spanish navy.
