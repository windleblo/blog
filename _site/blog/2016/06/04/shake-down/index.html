<h2 id="windleblo-being-launched-at-south-freeport">Windleblo being launched at South Freeport</h2>

<p>Yesterday we took a shake down sail around Casco Bay to exercise boat and crew. All systems are now “GO” for blast off to Nova Scotia next week. Preliminary forecasts look good for crossing mid-week. My passage plan is to shove off the dock at South Freeport on Tuesday for a 40 nm day sail to Monhegan Island. We’ll tie up to a mooring there for one night, then cross 200 nm around Cape Sable and make landfall at Shelburn, NS, by the end of the day Thursday. Cross your fingers that the forecast continues to look good.</p>

<p>For those who want to know, below is pasted the day by day spring commissioning punch list we accomplished to get this far.</p>

<p>May 16-18 – drive Honda loaner car (Enterprise Toyota Corolla) from Denver to Falmouth, ME</p>

<p>May 19 – Move gear onto boat (e.g., new carpet – fits great); assess head valve situation (tank isolation valve frozen), cycle through hulls – all OK except head tank isolation valve; topsides cleaned and waxed (by Eric – boatyard worker); check battery water – all OK. Found battery status at 100%. Connected to shore power to charge.</p>

<p>May 20 – Prep bottom for antifouling paint application – light sanding, remove bowthruster props, remove zincs, tape waterline and fittings; engine work with Bob – check exhaust elbow and heat exchanger, remove Webasto for bench check, remove Webasto fuel filter for replacement, replace impeller</p>

<h2 id="may-21--apply-antifouling-paint">May 21 – apply antifouling paint</h2>

<p>May 22 – Install bilge plug; apply second coat of antifouling paint to high need areas – bow, front of keel &amp; rudder, water line; varnish flagstaff, washboards, companionway teak</p>

<p>May 24 – Apply another coat of varnish to flagstaff, washboards and companionway teak; move stands and prep patches behind them for antifouling paint; retrieved life raft from Chase Leavitt; clean, lube and reassemble bowthruster props; disassemble, clean, lube, and reassemble Flex-o-fold prop; replaced Isotherm, bowthruster, and Flex-o-fold zincs</p>

Removed expansion tank for replacement.</p>

<p>May 27 – spoke with John Brewer re satphone antenna breakage caused by shrink wrap cover – he seemed to say he would have it taken care of. In the process, he called my wind generator mast “rinky dink.” He also announced that we could either launch Tuesday or get the deck polished Tuesday and launch Wednesday. I said we would launch Tuesday. He then said we would have to do our own deck polishing and he would provide tools and materials; added coolant (60% H2O, 40% Volvo coolant) to engine and topped off engine oil with 15W40; mounted MOB gear on pushpit, including danbuoy, horseshoe buoy, and lifesling – lifesling was in new warrantied replacement case; cleaned shroud deck plates; cleaned &amp; polished nav light mounting brackets, installed nav lights and wired them in place; painted anchor locker boards and dinghy seat with second coat of gray paint; applied final coat of varnish to washboards &amp; flagstaff. Received notice that zip code was entered wrong by HR-Parts on the shipment of head valves, delaying delivery until Tuesday.</p>

<p>May 28 – started treating and buffing deck smooth gelcoat – used Polar Shine per John Brewer recommendation – it did not completely clean the gelcoat; removed watermaker motor to take to bench and replace sprocket; replaced watermaker filters; used heat gun to remove expansion tank fitting; organized V-berth holds; cleaned up head holding tank valve assembly fittings; polished head stay attachment point at bow roller; seized anchor shackle; installed Furuno – loaded Canadian charts; connected propane line</p>
