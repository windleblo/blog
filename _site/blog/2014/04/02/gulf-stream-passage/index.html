The Bahama crew departed this morning – Lisa Lola and Zafod flew off to Slick City this morning – and our Gulf Stream Passage crew is on board. Alessandra Brown, 18-year-old daughter of Tim and Kathy Brown, joined us yesterday. Tomorrow, we shove off at 0700 for a 135-nautical-mile crossing to Merritt Island, Florida, and our first landfall in the U.S. of A. Neptune is smiling upon us. Force Three to Four winds behind the beam and fair skies are forecast for the entire crossing. A waxing moon will be up for a few hours tomorrow evening, then the star show begins. We are very excited to be on the cusp of finally bringing Windleblo to its home country. Next post will be from the Intracoastal Waterway!" />
