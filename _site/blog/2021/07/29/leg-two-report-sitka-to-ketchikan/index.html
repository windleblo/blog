    <p>Shore leave over, daughter Emily joined me in Sitka for a modified Leg Two, Sitka to Ketchikan. We had 10 days to cover 260 nautical miles, taking in a return (for me) to Warm Springs, marine wildlife at Tebenkof Bay, the raw solitude of Coronation Island, and a half circumnavigation of Prince of Wales Island.</p>

<p>I asked Emily to select her favorite photos of the voyage. Here’s what she picked:</p>

<p>A close encounter, flukes and all!</p>

<p><img src="http://windleblo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_9477-768x1024.jpg" alt="" />Deer Mountain trail near Ketchikan. We climbed from sea level to 1,500 feet.</p>

<p><img src="http://windleblo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_9478-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="" />The first post-COVID cruise ship to visit Ketchikan. Notice the paddleboarder in front of the ship.</p>

<p>All in all, a very fun successful cruise.</p>

<p>While we were at it, Canada announced intentions to admit vaccinated Americans into their country starting August 9th. Unfortunately, it does not appear the Council of the Haida Nation will follow suit, so we will have to forego a visit to Gwaii Haanas for now.</p>

<p>So of necessity we are modifying the 2021 Cruising Plan as we go. Our new Plan A is to head offshore for a 5-night bluewater cruise from Ketchikan to Port Townsend, WA, never touching Canada. Watching now for a weather window. Son John and good friend John Renna arrive tomorrow for the crossing. Soon, the last of southeast Alaska for the Windleblo in 2021 will be in the log books.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>
