<p>Launch Day!</p>

<p>10 days. That’s how long it took to get the <em>Windleblo</em> ready this year.</p>

<p>Rather than list all the spring commissioning tasks “for the record” as in past years, this season will be by exception.</p>

<p>The big exception is that Jocelyn was not with me to share in the joys and trials of spring commissioning. Her mom, Darlene, recently moved from Albuquerque to Denver to be closer to us. Though generally doing well, she landed in the hospital the week before last. She was discharged only a day before we were to leave for Detroit. Jocelyn canceled her trip to help her mom gain back her strength.</p>

<p>That left it to me to plow through the spring commissioning punch list. Thankfully, everything went smoothly, dare I say routinely. The only non-routine step was installing new curtains hand made by Jocelyn over the winter.</p>

<p>Rick Vincent and his wife, Elizabeth, owner/operators of Sailors Cove Marina, have been very welcoming. The launch Friday was flawless. John Hranac arrived Saturday to help with final preparations.</p>

<p>We expect to shove off tomorrow to ascend the St. Clair River for Sarnia, Ontario. It’ll be good to be back north of the border.</p>
