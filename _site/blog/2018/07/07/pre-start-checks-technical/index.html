<meta name="description" content="Apologies to followers looking for more entertainment. This post is decidedly more on the technical side. Leg Two crewman John Hoopes suggests written checklists to help new and returning crew learn or relearn onboard procedure. Several are sprinkled in past blog entries. In an attempt to begin to consolidate these, below is a list guiding routine steps for getting under way at the start of a typical Windleblo voyaging day. A caveat: The checklist is not intended to be comprehensive. Many steps beyond those listed go into readiness for disembarking. A few examples not covered here are detailed passage planning, provisioning, and safety equipment checks. The list below is only meant as a guide for day-to-day steps before leaving the dock, mooring, or anchorage. Pre-Start Checklist 1. Stow all gear below decks. 2. Close all hatches, then double check that all are secured. 3. Gimbal stove. 4. Close head valves; check that shower Plexiglas panel is secured. 5. Check engine – WOBBLED – If anything is amiss, notify captain. a. Water – Check that raw water intake through hull valve is open; open coolant “radiator” cap and inspect coolant level. Adjust as needed. b. Oil – Check dipstick oil level. Every 3rd time check gearbox fluid level. Adjust as needed. c. Belts – Check alternator/water pump belt tension. Should deflect no more than ¾”. d. Bilge – Look beneath engine for anything unusual, e.g., coolant or lubricant leaks. e. ‘Lectric – Inspect integrity of alternator wiring connections. f. Exhaust – Check raw water discharge with exhaust as soon as engine is started. g. Diesel – Turn on meter at electric panel to make sure fuel tank shows sufficient fuel for intended voyage. 6. Check rig a. Systematically go around entire deck inspecting all fasteners for integrity, especially shackle seizings. Make any needed corrections. b. Check that all running rigging is properly coiled and secured. Adjust as needed. c. Check that dinghy is secured. d. Carefully scan aloft for any sign of improper rigging. Correct as needed. 7. If docked or on mooring ball, check that anchor is secured. Inspect anchor shackle seizing for integrity. If anchored, check anchor shackle seizing upon retrieval. 8. Put binoculars and horn on chart table behind chart plotter. 9. Put logbook and pen on chart table in front of chart plotter. 10. Remove binnacle cover. Stow in cockpit locker. 11. Activate instruments. a. On electric panel, turn on i. A.pilot, Speed, Wind ii. VHF iii. Radar Plotter b. Remove and stow instrument covers. c. Depress chart plotter and autopilot “on” buttons on each instrument. d. Once chart plotter is on, depress “Rotokey” to clear yellow disclaimer statement. 12. Plot the day’s course on the chart plotter. 13. Start engine a. Check that engine “Start” breaker is closed. It is behind the fuse panel door below the Nav Station seat. b. Depress ignition switch (top left) on four switch engine control panel mounted on binnacle facing aft forward of wheel. Look for engine hours to appear on digital readout screen and listen for two beeps. c. Depress start button on engine control panel briefly (top right) to activate glow plugs. Watch digital readout screen for glow plug symbol. d. While glow plugs are on, disengage clutch by depressing plunger at bottom of engine control arm. While disengaged, move engine control arm forward to 1,200 rpm position. e. Once glow plug symbol expires and engine hours are displayed, depress and hold start button until engine starts. (Shouldn’t take more than a few cranks.) Adjust engine control arm to 1,200 rpm if necessary. f. Check exhaust for discharge of engine cooling water. If none is detected, IMMEDIATELY TURN ENGINE OFF using stop button on engine control panel (bottom right) and investigate why. Correct as needed. g. Warm engine for at least five minutes prior to departure. 14. Collect the crew in the cockpit and conduct briefing prior to disembarking, e.g., voyage overview, crew assignments for getting of the dock or weighing anchor, etc. 15. Don PFDs. 16. Disembark – Weigh anchor or cast off from dock or mooring." />
