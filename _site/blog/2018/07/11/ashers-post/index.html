    <p><em>The following is a guest blog entry by Asher Herbstman, who has joined the Windleblo crew for Leg Two of this season’s voyage. – ed.</em></p>

<p>Hi all.</p>

<p>This is Asher, a new crewman on the Windleblo. A lot has been going on since I left my home a week ago to sail on the <em>Windleblo</em>. I have been introduced to the complex world of sailing, which I am trying my hardest to understand, and the world of Canada, which I have given up on attempting to understand years ago. The voyage that we are going on is throughout the North Channel of Lake Huron. If I had one word to describe this Canadian lake it would be “really-awesome” with a hyphen, because I’m pretty sure that a hyphen would make it into one word.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that the voyage is short in distance, we are able to explore Canada, going from cove and anchoring for a day or sometimes longer. While anchored, we swim, fish, hike around the nearby land, and read. A typical day ends with a nice sunset followed by an onslaught of mosquitos. Bug defenses have been put up but we have been in previous situations where the bugs found a breach and charged into the boat.</p>

<p>As a newcomer there is a lot of information that I have to absorb regarding the boat and sailing. I have had a lot of processes and concepts explained to me by the others on the boat and have used resources like the “RYA Competent Crew” book and the “Knots by Grog” app to further help me learn what I need to know. Although it was easy to feel overwhelmed with all this information coming at me, it was exciting and satisfying when I was able to complete even the simplest processes, such as flipping the right switches on the switchboard or using the unique boat toilet – a.k.a., the “head” – correctly.</p>

<p>I have learned a lot on the <em>Windleblo</em> and though there were times of uncertainty, like the time I was outnumbered by Johns 3 to 1, and the aforementioned time that I was outnumbered by mosquitos 200 to 1.</p>

<p>This trip has so far been incredible and I will never forget it.</p>
