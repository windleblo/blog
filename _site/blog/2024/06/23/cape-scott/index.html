<p>As I learned from the Healing Voyage two seasons ago, there are four “gauntlets” to endure when circumnavigating Vancouver Island: the Seymour Narrows, the Nahwitti Bar, Cape Scott, and the Brooks Peninsula. This time around, we decided to make the most of the third gauntlet, Cape Scott.</p>

<p>Conditions permitting, we would pull into Guise Bay, a small indent in the land just south of the Cape, anchor, and launch the dinghy to land ashore for a hike to the Cape Scott lighthouse.</p>

<p>Available information in pilot books and apps paints Guise Bay as a wild, somewhat precarious anchorage suitable for a stop only in settled weather. Inspecting the chart, rocky shoals protect the bay on the west, leaving it wide open to the Pacific to the south. One had to wonder how suitable it would be. Would ocean swell invade the bay, making it uncomfortable or even impossible to launch the dinghy? Would winds create chop causing more difficulty? We were determined to find out.</p>

<p>Leaving our previous anchorage, Bull Harbour, around Noon in light air, we crossed Nahwitti Bar without incident at high slack. The ebb tide pushed us along as we motored twenty nautical miles off the north end of Vancouver Island toward the Cape.</p>

<p><img src="http://windleblo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PHOTO-2024-06-19-21-26-23-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" />Happy to be ashore</p>

<p>The chart shows the Cape Scott light right at the tip of the Cape. It says the light shines from a height of 70 meters. As soon as we got close enough, I started scanning the Cape through binoculars, but I saw no tall lighthouse. A more careful scan as we sailed closer revealed what appeared to be red rooves barely visible through the treetops on a rise just above the Cape. The light wasn’t on a tall tower, it was perched on a tall hill!</p>

<p>We motored on, rounding the Cape. Currents swirled and the ebb push abruptly ended. Very soon, we turned in on final approach into Guise Bay. A huge sea lion barked at us from his perch atop rocks guarding the entrance to the bay. His harem looked on approvingly.</p>

<p>Soon a pristine kilometer-long white sand beach came into view. The anchor set instantly in seven meters just off the beach. A black bear roamed the far end of beach, far enough away not to be a concern. It helped that we were downwind of him!</p>

<p>Even Neptune gazed favorably upon us. The swell was slight, less than one meter, and the winds were 10 knots from the north, coming over the land and not agitating the sea at all. Our plan could proceed. Once back from the hike, if conditions deteriorated we could still weigh anchor and make it the five nautical miles to the next anchorage south in daylight.</p>

<p>We launched the dinghy and rowed to shore, hauling the dinghy up to near the high tide line and lashing it to a stout log. Orange buoys marked the trailhead at the west end of the beach. Walking was easy through thick mossy forest on remnants of a plank and sand road built in the 1940’s to enable crews to shuttle between a top secret radar outpost on the hill and their barracks below.</p>

<p>Half an hour later we ascended the hill and emerged from the trees to encounter bright sunshine and manicured lawns on the lighthouse grounds. Several whitewashed buildings, all with red metal rooves, a helipad, and, of course, the lighthouse platform comprised the station. Presently, a lady in her 60’s came out of one of the buildings. She introduced herself as Jane and offered to tour us around.</p>

<p>The tour started with an ascent of a steep ladder to the top of the lighthouse platform where we were rewarded with stunning views of the Cape and adjacent seas on one side and the mountains of Vancouver Island on the other. The tour continued with a visit to the meteorological station, where we viewed old photos of the station under construction.</p>

<p>The radar station built during World War II was turned over to the Canadian Coast Guard in 1959 for conversion into a lighthouse. The seas around Cape Scott had long been known as a ship’s graveyard, making a light there essential. The light shines once every 10 seconds through an old-fashioned Fresnel lens, brightly visible to a range of 19 nautical miles out at sea. Three dwellings were built near the lighthouse to house the light keepers. In September 1981, a new tower was built to replace the old one on the radar foundation. Solar photovoltaic panels have now replaced two diesel generators for powering the station.</p>

<p>The tour over, we bid Jane good day and retraced our steps over the rough plank trail back to Guise Bay, taking a brief detour for a stop at an alluring gravel beach with windswept evergreens atop rock spires. The weather forecast predicted steady conditions through the night with 10 knot winds over the land to the north and slight seas from the west. We elected to remain at anchor in Guise Bay, a real treat considering its remoteness. In the morning, the anchor up, we left the bay. Once clear of the bay, the winds increased to 15 knots. We pointed Windleblo south, switched off the motor, and put out a sliver of headsail and a trolling line to stern. Cape Scott still in view, two salmon struck my lure in turn, offering fresh catch for dinner.</p>
